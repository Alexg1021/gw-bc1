        Final Project Overview

            <h2 class="text-center sub">Project Structure</h2>

            <div class="point">
                Before we begin, let's outline the project folder structure. You should all have an empty folder created 
                called TodoApp. In the folder, create a CSS folder and a JS folder. Open up Sublime and under the <code>file</code> 
                menu select <code>open folder</code> and navigate to your "TodoApp" project folder. Set up your project as a Github 
                repo using git init.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
            	Now that your folders are created and your github repo is set up, create an <code>index.html</code> file in the main 
            	directory. Also, create a <code>scripts.js</code> file in your js folder.
            </div>

            <div class="point">Your project folder structure should look like this.</div>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">
    TodoApp/
    |--css/
    | |--style.css
    |
    |--js/
    | |--scripts.js
    |
    |--index.html
</code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">
                Every project needs a file structure; this is the most basic one you will use when creating a
                simple Vanilla Javascript Application. The next thing to do is to think about what we're building and
                how to build it piece by piece.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The first thing we should always do is think about what our desired result is. I'm going to
                give a brief description of what the application should do, along with some details and specifics about
                each of the features this TodoApp should have. How you accomplish the task is completely up to you.
                There are a million ways to skin a cat, or in developer speak; a million ways to code the same
                thing.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                While developing this Todo app please keep in mind Edge Casing. For example: stopping a user from adding
                an empty Todo item.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Keep in mind you may use any frontend framework to help you make the UI fancy. Actually it's encouraged
                and extra points <strong>will</strong> be given.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                TodoApp simply allows users to type in any given task and add it to a list of
                things they want to do. After a todo task is added a user should be able to edit, delete or complete the task.
            </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <h1 class="text-center sub">User Interface (UI)</h1>

            <div class="point">
                When building an application the first thing you always do is built out the user interface. Most
                developers like to draw out on paper or in photoshop some mockups of what the app might look like in
                order to help them lay out the skeleton design of the HTML.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The user interface for a todo app is relatively simple: we need an input field in order to type in what items we want to do, we need a list to hold our Todo items in and we need a button to actually insert the text in the
                input field into the list of items. This design logic, however, only takes care of adding
                some tasks to a list of items.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                In order to add the functionality to edit, remove or complete a Todo we need to think on a more specific
                level. What are we editing, removing or completing? The Todo item, right? Aren't we going to need some
                type of way to call some function for each of these features? So, to fine tune our UI requirements we'll
                need a list item with a checkbox inside it, and a few buttons; one to edit, one to delete.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                At this point your UI requirements are complete and you can start building the Javascript logic.
            </div>

        </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <h1 class="text-center sub">Javascript Logic</h1>

            <div class="point">
                This is the hard part. It's time to use the elements (HTML) you created to make your Todo app do what it
                needs to do. Hopefully you assigned each of the main elements that your users will interact with some
                ids so you can target them in your Javascript. If not, do so now. Let's go over what each UI Element
                that calls a function will do.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Input Field</u>: The input field is where the user will type in what they want Todo. This field should
                be cleared each time its text is added to the list of things Todo.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Add Todo Button</u>: This is the button that will call our function to add a new Todo to the list.
                The logic behind this function is to dynamically create a new <code>Todo Item</code> list item element
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (List Item)</u>: This is the element that gets created when you click your add todo button.
                It should contain the text of the Todo (text of the input field), a checkbox (for completing) and the
                two buttons to edit and delete the items.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Checkbox)</u>: When a user checks this you should add some kind of class to the list item
                that strikes through the text and makes the text lighter. Also, the text should not be editable while this is checked (hide the edit button.)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Edit Button)</u>: Refer to this <a
                    href="https://jsfiddle.net/5ocdvpdy/1/">JSFiddle</a> to see how to turn an input field into text. We're
                doing the same thing in our project, except this time we're turning the text of the list item into an input field,
                allowing ourselves to edit it, and then turning it back into plain text when the user hits enter. So if you think
                about it, you're creating an input element with an event listener listening for when the user hits the
                enter key. (Do some Google'ing, it's good for you!)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Delete Button)</u>: Fairly simple, remove the entire List Item(li) this button is held within. How
                can you target the parent element of the button? The user should be prompted whether they are sure they want
                to delete the Todo before it is deleted.
            </div>

                First let's remember that this class is not accredited, meaning this grade does not mean much on any
                academic level. This grade scaling system is strictly meant to give the student a rough idea of how they
                grew and where they're at by the end of the class.
