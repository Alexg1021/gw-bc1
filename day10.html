            <div class="point">
                As we've seen so far, all of our event handlers are attached directly to the element they work with.
                We attached click handlers on our li tags to alert a movie title, etc...  When this happens 1 copy
                of the function is created and stored for every event listener.  Imagine if we had an HTML list with
                500 items in it.  If we wanted to register a callback for every one of the li tags, that would
                store 500 copies of a callback function in memory!  There is a better way!
            </div>

            <h3>Event Bubbling</h3>

            <div class="point">
                In order to leverage a better way of using event listeners, we have to first understand
                how events in a browser work.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The idea of <code>event bubbling</code> simply means that an event bubbles up the DOM tree, triggering
                the given event <strong>on every node</strong> up the DOM tree.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                So if I click on a button, the click event starts at the button, then moves to its parent, then
                to that element's parent and so on, until it reaches the top of the document.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Let's create an example that uses event bubbling so that it becomes more clear how we might be
                able to use this.  Start with a ul that has 5 lis in it.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-markup">
        &lt;ul id="myul"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;baz&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;bleep&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;bloop&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now I want to be able to click on any li and alert the text of that node.  But instead of attaching
                an event listener to every li, I'll just do it on the ul.  When we click on a li, the event will
                bubble up to its parent (the UL) and the click event handler we'll set up will fire.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        document.getElementById("myul").addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
        console.log(this);
        console.log(evt);
        });
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                OK, so what is the <code>this</code> context in our callback?  It's the ul, right?  So how can we
                know which li was actually clicked on that caused the click event that bubbled to the ul?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Let's take a closer look at the <code>evt</code> object that the event handler received.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        document.getElementById("myul").addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
        console.log(evt);
        });
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                If we look closely, you'll see there is a property there called <code>target</code>. This
                property on the event object will contain the node we actually clicked on.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Now lets use this new <code>evt.target</code> property to get the <code>textContent</code> of
                the li we clicked on and alert that.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        document.getElementById("myul").addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
        alert(evt.target.textContent);
        });
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now we only have 1 event handler for click events. Through the <code>evt</code> object
                we can determine which thing was actually clicked on and do something with it.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Event delegation can single-handedly reduce memory consumption of your app by great amounts if
                used properly.

            <h2 class="text-right">Array Sorting</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <div class="point">
                We've done quite a bit with arrays up to this point, and they've proven to be a useful data structure for
                holding content when order matters.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                One useful function we've yet to discuss is sorting an array.  Arrays come with built-in methods that
                allow for sorting an array in just about any way imaginable.  Let's start by taking a look at a numeric
                sort.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        var nums = [4, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 8];
        console.log(nums.sort());
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">Awesome! We get the array sorted by number.  Let's try a different example:</div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        var nums = [100, 10, 4, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 8];
        console.log(nums.sort());
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice anything odd about the way that array was sorted?  Here is a good example of why Javascript sometimes
                can leave you scratching your head.  We can see that we got something like 1, 10, 100, 2, ....  Why is that?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The answer is that by default, JS will sort things in Unicode order, which gives you something like the result
                above.  So how can we make this act in a more sane way?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The sort function actually takes an argument that is a function.  This function can do the job of determining
                how to sort the array, which means that you can sort in numerous ways.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The sorting function looks like this:
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        var nums = [100, 10, 4, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 8];
        nums.sort(function (a, b) {
        //inspect a and b to determine how things should be sorted
        });
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                The sorting function receives two arguments, usually aliased to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  These
                are two elements from the array.  The sorting function's job is to compare the two array items and determine
                which is larger.  The return value of the sorting function will determine if the "a" element is sorting higher
                or lower than the "b" element.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                It works like this:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>If the return value of the sorting function is a negative number, sort <code>a</code> lower than <code>b</code>.</li>
                    <li>If the return value of the sorting function is a positive number, sort <code>a</code> higher than <code>b</code>.</li>
                    <li>If the return value is 0, this signifies that the values are equal, so do not change these elements' order.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                So, one quick way of sorting numbers might look like:
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        var nums = [100, 10, 4, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 8];
        nums.sort(function (a, b) {
        return a - b;
        });
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Let's hypothetically say a = 100 and b = 10;  100 - 10 === 90 (a positive number.) So <code>a</code>
                would be sorted higher than <code>b</code>.  If a = 10 and b = 100, then 10 - 100 === -90, so <code>a</code>
                would be sorted lower than <code>b</code>.
            </div>

            <h3>Array String Sorting</h3>

            <div class="point">
                String sorting for arrays is a little nicer than numbers.  You can use greater than / less than operators
                with strings where "a" is the lowest value and "z" is the highest value.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: In your console, run <code>"a" < "z"</code> then run <code>"z" < "a"</code>.  The result should
                    be <code>true</code> then <code>false</code>, because "a" is less than "z" and "z" is not less than "a".
                    This is what the sort function does for strings.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Let's sort an array of strings.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        var strings = ["cherry", "apple", "berry"];
        strings.sort();

        console.log(strings);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Without much intervention on our part, an array of strings can be sorted just by calling sort on it.
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-right">Organizing an Application</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <div class="point">
                As we begin writing more JS to handle our page interactions, it's important to organize our application
                in a way that will allow for ease of use / maintenance in the future
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Let's talk about some best practices for structuring our application for the final project.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                We've talked a lot about function scope and how functions create their own scope which is inaccessible
                from outer scopes.  We've also talked a lot about how anything written in an "outermost" scope (global
                scope) will become part of the global scope (IE the window object.)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                When you begin writing a lot of Javascript, it becomes desirable to <strong>NOT</strong> make everything
                part of the global scope.  We want to avoid cluttering the global scope with every function, variable, and
                object we create.  This is just good practice.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                So how do we avoid creating EVERYTHING on the global scope?  Let's try something.  Run the code below in
                your console.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        > window.foo //undefined
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Simply trying to access window.foo returns undefined, because it's not yet been created.  So let's
                create it.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        function foo() { alert("foo"); }
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now try accessing window.foo
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        window.foo //function () {...}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now that we've created the function foo, it's actually part of the global scope; <code>window</code>.
                This is what we want to try to avoid.  So, how do we do that?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The most common way is with something called an <code>IIFE</code> or Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                With an <code>IIFE</code> you essentially create a function that gets called immediately that will enclose
                all of our functionality within a function. This means <code>NOTHING</code> will be able to clutter our
                global scope (some exceptions do apply.)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                First, let's demonstrate what an <code>IIFE</code> looks like
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        (function () {
        //your code goes here
        }());
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So what is going on here?  Let's pick it apart...
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                We have an outermost set of parentheses that contain a function, followed by an inner set of parentheses.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The outermost set of parentheses followed by the function keyword tells Javascript to expect a function
                expression and not a function declaration.  The innermost parentheses will immediately call the anonymous
                function and execute the function body.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                OK, why do we need this?  As we discussed previously, functions create a new scope. Functions,
                variables, etc that are created in the <code>IIFE</code> belong to that scope, not the global scope.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                In this way, we can have Javascript files that are only concerned with their own purposes; to capitalize
                words, or create new elements, etc. This is known as writing <code>modular</code> code.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                One major gotcha here: if the "modules" that we are creating are created inside an <code>IIFE</code>,
                and an <code>IIFE</code> creates a new scope that the outer scopes can't reach, how can code in another
                file access our <code>e</code> function?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The short answer is: it can't.  You MUST assign something back to the window object, allowing other
                code to use it.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                To do this we need to define an attribute of the window object like so:
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <code>window.attribute = variable;</code>

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create an <code>IIFE</code> in your Javascript and assign a function to the window. in your console call the window attribute
                </div>
            </div>

                    <li>Add a <code>checkbox</code> to each <code>li</code> that, when checked, will lighten the text and add a strike-through</li>
                    <li>Add a <code>delete</code> button to each <code>li</code> that, when clicked, will confirm that the user wishes to delete the item and then remove it</li>
